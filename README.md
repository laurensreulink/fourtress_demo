### Setup
In order to use the notebook that is included you need to set up a virtual environment with some version of Python 3. Anaconda or virtualenv can be used to do this.  
All required libraries that are needed can be found in `requirements.txt`. After activating the virtual environment the packages are easily installed with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

After installation of all packages you can start the notebook program (Jupyter) with the command `jupyter noteboook`. A browser page is opened from where you can navigate to and open the notebook.
